Lecturer(s): Dr Yuanwei Liu, Dr Yan (Cindy) Sun

Summary



• equip participants with a basic understanding of modern digital communications;

• show how communications networks are evolving;

• introduce important fundamental topics in telecommunications theory.

• briefly discuss the latest 4G technologies, e.g. LTE and LTE-A.

The module provides a broad coverage of the principles of modern telecommunications systems including underlying theoretical concepts of information theory, baseband digital signalling as well as basic knowledge of source coding of different types of information and line coding;  bandpass modulations, spreading techniques, multiple access including OFDM, radio propagations and intersymbol interference; and wireless network architectures



Syllabus: 

Modern networks, particularly mobile including architecture, high-level properties.

Source coding: sampling, quantising, non-linear quantising, PCM, Huffman coding.

Information theory: Entropy, Markov models, Shannon-Hartley theorem, implications for broadband

Errors and impairments: impairments in cascade, probability of word error, forward error correction, linear block codes, effective bit rate in presence of errors

Baseband digital signalling techniques including line codes and spectra, intersymbol interference and time division multiplexing.

Modulation techniques including BPSK, MFSK, QPSK, QAM.

Spread spectrum such as HFSS and DSSS, and CDMA.

Multiple access techniques, especially OFDMA.

Radio prorogations and network architecture including multipath effects, cellular concept, diversity and handover.
