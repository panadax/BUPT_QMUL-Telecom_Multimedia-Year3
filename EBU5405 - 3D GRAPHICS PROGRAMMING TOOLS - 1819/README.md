# Introduction

Lecturer(s): Dr Marie-Luce Bourguet


This course introduces students to the basics of 3D graphics and to software tools commonly used in the design of virtual environments and games. In particular the course covers:
3D object modelling, camera models, transformations, lighting, clipping and rasterisation.


# Objectives:

- Understanding of the most relevant programming tools for 3D graphics.

- Ability to implement 3D graphics using OpenGL.

- Understand basic transformations and rendering techniques for the creation of virtual reality.

- Ability to implement computer generated animations.


# Aims

The aim of the course is to give the students fundamental knowledge about techniques for programming 3D graphics, computer driven animation and virtual reality applications.
At the end of the course the students will be able to understand the basic transformations and rendering techniques for the creation of virtual reality, and understand the most relevant programming tools for 3D graphics. 
Moreover the students will be able to implement computer generated animations and to implement 3D graphics using OpenGL.
