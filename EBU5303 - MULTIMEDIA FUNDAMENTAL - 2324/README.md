**Lecturer(s): Dr Marie-Luce Bourguet**

**Summary**

This module is an introduction to the representation, analysis and processing of digital multimedia. It covers topics such as sampling and quantisation, colour models, sound, image and video representations, compression and encoding, elements of psychoacoustics, elements of vision, JPEG, MPEG, MP3, and elements of digital broadcasting. The main methods of delivery are a mix of asynchronous activities (interactive videos, online quizzes, exercises) and synchronous sessions (live lectures and tutorials, and labs).

**Aims**
- Aim 1: To understand the signal-processing basis of multimedia representations and processing
- Aim 2: To analyse simple interactive multimedia content
- Aim 3: To apply digital signal processing techniques for the compression of multimedia data
- Aim 4: To describe modern multimedia standards and formats

**Syllabus**

1. Digitisation
Explain the difference between analogue and discrete signals; Discuss how digitisation causes aliasing and quantisation errors; Calculate the signal-to-noise ratio; Calculate the size of digital images, audio, and video files.

2. Colours
Relate colour properties with light; Compare colour models; Use the RGB model to encode a colour; Use the HSV model to describe a colour.

3. Images
Discuss and compare image representations; Define image resolution; Explain how colour information can be stored in bitmaps; Compare image file types.

4. Video and Audio
Apply the Nyquist theorem; Relate quantisation level and dynamic range of an audio file; Calculate decibels from air pressure; Calculate the signal-to-quantisation noise ratio; Interpret the spectral analysis of a speech signal; Describe the MIDI format.

5. Introduction to data compression
Compare lossless and lossy compression; Calculate a compression rate; Distinguish between data and information; Distinguish between different types of redundancy.

6. Lossless compression
Describe lossless compression techniques: RLE, LZW, Huffman; Use appropriate compression technique given data properties.

7. JPEG
