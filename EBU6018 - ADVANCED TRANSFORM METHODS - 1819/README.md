Time /frequency transforms are based on the Fourier Transform (FT), as introduced in Digital Signal Processing. 
However the application of the FT is limited to stationary signals, since time information in the time domain is lost in the frequency domain. This module revises the FT, linear algebra, principal component analysis (PCA), introduces non-stationary signals and investigates methods of retaining the time information in the transform. 
It then introduces time-frequency analysis techniques and explores how they are suitable for different signal and image processing applications such as filtering and compression. 
These techniques include the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Wavelet Transform (WT), Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and  Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT).

#Aims
The broad aims of this module are to introduce a variety of transforms and introduce how these may be applied to compression and other applications related to signal, image, video and audio processing.
