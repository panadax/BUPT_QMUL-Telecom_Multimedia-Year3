CBU5201 Machine Learning covers the fundamental concepts, methodology and practical tools necessary to understand, build and assess data-driven models to describe real-world systems and predict their behaviour. We will follow the standard machine learning taxonomy to organise problems and techniques into well-defined families (supervised and supervised learning) and subfamilies. We will pay particular attention to the methodology that we need to use to avoid and identify common pitfalls. State-of-the-art models and the latest developments on model deployment will be discussed.

**Aims**

The aims of this module are:

- to provide a rigorous understanding of the principles of machine learning and its applications.
- to provide a practical understanding of machine learning tools and approaches to model data to gain insight into real-world problems and produce predictions
- to allow you to critically engage with current and future developments in the field of data science.
