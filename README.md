# BUPT_QMUL-Telecom_Multimedia-Year3 
BUPT Joint Programme with QMUL (2023/24)

## Introduction:
This repository is about the course resources in Year 3 for `Telecommunication with Management(Multimedia)` students, forked by the repo of panadax. It will also be of use for the students in `Electronic Information Engineering` because of  the course similarity of the two majors.

## Why This?
I am devoted to establishing a platform to share resources which can help not make detours when previewing and reviewing courses.
<br /><br /> Therefore, I sincerely hope you who have other useful resources could share them here.
<br /><br /> Plus, I also hope you who are going to Year 3 can make good use of it, and **DO NOT** offer this to the printing shop like "SHUGUANG"(曙光打印店).
<br /><br /> This project aims to be **shared and nonprofit**. Thus, any commercial interests will violate original intention of our project.
