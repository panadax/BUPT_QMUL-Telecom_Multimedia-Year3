# BUPT_QMUL-Telecom_Multimedia-Year3 
BUPT Joint Programme with QMUL (2018/19)

## Introduction:
This repository is about the course resources in Year 3 for `Telecommunication with Management(Multimedia)` students.

## Why This?
We are devoted to establishing a platform to share resources which can help not make detours when previewing and reviewing courses.
<br /><br /> In addition, inspired by [清华大学计算机系课程攻略](https://github.com/Salensoft/thu-cst-cracker), the initiator chooses github platform. 
<br /><br /> Therefore, we sincerely hope you who have other useful resources could share them here.
<br /><br /> Plus, we also hope you who are going to Year 3 can make good use of it, and **DO NOT** offer this to the printing shop like "SHUGUANG"(曙光打印店).
<br /><br /> Becasue this project aims to be **shared and nonprofit**. Any commercial interests will violate original intention of our project.

<br /> <br />P.S.
